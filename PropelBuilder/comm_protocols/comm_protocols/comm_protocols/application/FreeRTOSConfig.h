are multiple command interpreters running at once (for example, one on a UART
and one on TCP/IP).  This is done to prevent an output buffer being defined by
each implementation - which would waste RAM.  In this case, there is only one
command interpreter running, and it has its own local output buffer, so the
global buffer is just set to be one byte long as it is not used and should not
take up unnecessary RAM. */
